# Neighborhood Map (React) Project


## Project Overview
This is the Project 7 (Maps) in Udacity's Front End Nano-Degree program. Using React I created a single-page application featuring a map.

## Installing and launching
- Clone or download the Repository
- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the app with `npm start`

## Service Worker
To access the service worker the you need to build the project using `npm run build` and then deploy the project.
The service worker lets the app load faster on subsequent visits **only in the production mood**, and gives it offline capabilities.
